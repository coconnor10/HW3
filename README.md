# Password Generator

This is a project for coding bootcamp. It has been designed to generate a random password based on the chosen prompted criteria. When the red button is clicked, the user will be prompted to pick different types of characters to use, as well as a password length. Once all the prompts are answered, a randomize password will be displayed on the page.
